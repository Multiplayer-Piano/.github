# Welcome to the `Multiplayer Piano` GitHub organization!
Alternatively named `mppnet`/`mppclone`/`Multiplayer Piano Clone`.

(information here will be updated as soon as possible/notified)

### Up-to-date Resources & Websites
- Playable Websites:
  1. https://multiplayerpiano.net/ (stable)
  2. https://www.multiplayerpiano.org/ (mirror website to previous)
  3. https://dev.multiplayerpiano.net/ (unstable: but gets bleeding edge updates and feature tests)
- Coding Resources:
  - https://github.com/mppnet/frontend: the official GitHub repo for the open-sourced client (currently)
- Social Media:
  - https://mppclone.reddit.com/: the official subreddit
  - https://discord.gg/338D2xMufC: the official Discord server
  - https://mpp.community/: the official community forum

### Outdated Resources & Websites
- Coding Resources:
  - https://github.com/multiplayerpiano: the old GitHub organization (not actively maintained by anyone updating the code nowadays, for now)

## AVOID SITES/EMAILS BELOW!!!
- `multiplayerpiano [dot] com`: they piggy back off of the offical website as a mirror, but plaster it with ADs.

They abuse the free service provided, to essentially gain money off of the project.

**You wouldn't want to support that, right?**

Also, avoid these, which were taken over by the same people:
  - `discord.com/invite [forward slash] Xr5dubEYgV`: the old Discord server
  - `multiplayerpiano [dot] com@gmail.com`: the old contact email
